# 🛡️ Fraud Detection and Risk Assessment MLOps Project

This project aims to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for **loan fraud detection and risk assessment**, integrating MLOps best practices MLflow, model training and evaluation, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), and deployment on **Hugging Face Spaces** using FastAPI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ End-to-end ML pipeline using Scikit-learn
- ✅ MLflow for model tracking , CI/CD with GitHub Actions (linting, testing, reproducibility)
- ✅ FastAPI-based deployment
- ✅ Auto-deployed on Hugging Face Spaces
- ✅ Label encoding, scaling, metrics logging
- ✅ Modular source code in `src/`
